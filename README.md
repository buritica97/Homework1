Unit 1 Home Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
   
    Kiva

    ![Kiva](https://umonarch.ch/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/KIva-Header.jpeg)

    Kiva means "unity" in Swahili. 

* When was the company incorporated?

    Kiva was founded in October 2005. 
    Kiva is based in San Francisco, California.  
    Kiva has offices across the world, for example in Bangkok, Nairobi, & Portland.

* Who are the founders of the company?

    Matt Flannery & Jessica Jackley 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    In 2003 Jessica Jackley and Matt Flannery became interested in microfinance after attending a lecture given by Grameen Bank's Muhammad Yunus at Stanford Business School. Both Jackley and Flannery spent some time in Africa interviewing entrepreneurs about the problems they face when trying to start a new business. Throughout their research Jackley and Flannery saw that most entrepreneurs struggled with a lack of access to start-up capital. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

    Kiva is founded by crowdfunding. Lenders crowdfund the loan in increments of $25 or more. At the end of the loan cycle lenders have the option to use repayments to fund new loans, donate, or withdraw the money.

    According to it's website Kiva is also supported by grants, loans, and donations from its users, corporations, and national institutions. Some of its major partners include The MasterCard Foundation, the HP Foundation, Capital One, the Pepsico Foundation & the Metlife Foundation just to name a few.



## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    Kiva's mission statment is "to expand financial access to help underserved comminitities thrive." 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)



* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

    According to Investopedia, "microloans are small loans that are issued by individuals rather than banks or credit unions." In many cases, like it is for Kiva, microloans are given to impoverished people in Third World countries who otherwise lack access to traditional financing options.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

    A major company in this domain is Grameen Bank. Grameen Bank is a microfinance organisation that was founded in Bangladesh in 1983. 

    Another major company in this domain is the Kashf Foundation. The Kashf Foundation is a non-profit, microfinance, and wealth organization, founded in Pakistan in 1996.

    Lending Club and Prosper are other financial institutions that provide microloans to their customers. Although it is important to note that unlike Kiva, Lending Club and Prosper mostly lend to individuals in developed countries who usually cannot apply for a more traditional loan. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

    One metric in which we may compare Kiva and Grameen Bank is the repayment rate: (as of 2017) Grameen Bank's repayment rate was of 99.6% and (as of 2019) Kiva's repayment rate was between 96% and 97%. 




## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
